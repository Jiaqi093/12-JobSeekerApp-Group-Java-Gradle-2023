This protocol outlines the procedures to address conflicts and challenges that may arise during our week 7 to week 11 project.
It encompasses a wide range of scenarios, including member performance issues, decision-making, and some unforeseen incidents.

A. Peer Mediation:
When team members face conflicts or disagreements.

Procedure:
1. Team members are encouraged to resolve conflicts among themselves before escalating the issue.
2. If a conflict persists, a neutral team member, chosen by consensus or designated in advance, shall mediate the discussion.
3. The mediator ensures both parties can express their views. The conflicting parties work together to find a mutually acceptable resolution.

B. Respect for Others:
Disagreements or personal tensions among team members.

Procedure:
1. Treat every team member with kindness, empathy, and professionalism always.
2. Avoid personal attacks, criticism, or derogatory language during discussions. Focus on constructive communication.
3. Value diversity and different perspectives, recognizing that these enrich the project's outcomes.

C. Active Listening:
When team members need to communicate effectively.

Procedure:
1. Pay full attention when team members are speaking, without interrupting or forming immediate judgments.
2. Reflect on what you've heard to ensure you've understood correctly. Ask clarifying questions to dig deeper into the issue or suggestion being discussed.

D. Openness to Different Opinions:
When team members need to make decisions or engage in discussions.

Procedure:
1. Create an environment where diverse viewpoints are valued and encouraged.
2. Avoid dismissing ideas or feedback without thoughtful consideration.
3. Engage in constructive debates and discussions, focusing on the issue rather than personal biases.

E. Setting Clear Goals:
To align team members and maintain focus.

Procedure:
1. Define Objectives: Define project objectives and individual roles and responsibilities clearly.
2. Communication: Ensure that every team member understands the project's overall purpose and how their contributions align with it.
3. Progress Updates: Continuously communicate progress toward achieving these goals to keep everyone informed.

F. Contingency Planning:
Unforeseen incidents or member issues.

Procedure:
1. If a member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines, address the issue promptly through peer mediation or team discussions. Adjust timelines or redistribute tasks as needed.
2. For group issues, follow the peer mediation process to reach a consensus or solve the problem.
3. In case of member sickness or unforeseen incidents, have a contingency plan in place to mitigate the impact on the project. Redistribute tasks or seek temporary assistance as needed.
